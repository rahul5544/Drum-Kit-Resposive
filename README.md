This is a simple web application that allows users to play a virtual drum kit by pressing certain keys on their keyboard. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The HTML code defines the structure of the web page, including the title, heading, drum buttons, and footer. The CSS code styles the elements of the page, including the font, background, and positioning of the elements. The JavaScript code handles the interactivity of the web page, including detecting key presses and playing sounds when the drum buttons are pressed.

To use the application, simply load the web page in a web browser and press the corresponding keys on your keyboard to play the drum sounds. The buttons on the web page also respond to mouse clicks, so you can use your mouse to play the drums as well.

The application was made by Rahul and includes his name in the footer. The application is licensed under an open-source license, so feel free to use and modify the code as you wish.
